## Purpose

Why make a framework when there are so may good options out there? My reason to prove to myself that I learned something, it is best to respond to a lesson by putting it into your own words to prove that you know what was taught, also cements it into the mind and provides notes for the future. Problem solving through some of the pieces also provides a memorable journey that can be reflected on and improve instincts when dealing with future problems.
